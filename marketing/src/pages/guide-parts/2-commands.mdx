## What special chat commands are available?

##### Put these directly as they appear here into the chat command setting field, including any $ symbols etc.

### **$gw2_account$**

This will require viewer to put in their Guild Wars 2 account names in the format matching **Test.1234** - it handles names with spaces too

### **$steam_friend$**

This will require viewer to put in their 8-digit Steam Friend Code in the format matching **12345678**

### **$gw2_or_steam$**

This will match either the **$gw2_account$** or **$steam_friend$** chat commands above
